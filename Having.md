### The HAVING clause in SQL is used to filter results after an aggregation has been performed, making it useful for conditions on aggregate functions like SUM, COUNT, MAX, MIN, or AVG. It is often used in conjunction with the GROUP BY clause, as it allows you to filter groups rather than individual rows.

## Syntax

SELECT column1, column2, AGGREGATE_FUNCTION(column3)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1, column2
HAVING condition;

## Key Points
WHERE vs. HAVING: WHERE filters rows before aggregation, while HAVING filters groups after aggregation.

Requires an Aggregate Function: The HAVING clause is typically used to filter based on aggregate function results, such as COUNT, SUM, etc.

### Example
Suppose we have a sales table with columns salesperson, region, and sales_amount. If we want to find all salespeople who have made sales greater than $5,000 in total, we could use the HAVING clause as follows:


SELECT salesperson, SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY salesperson
HAVING total_sales > 5000;

### Explanation
GROUP BY salesperson: Groups the rows by each salesperson.
SUM(sales_amount): Calculates the total sales for each salesperson.
HAVING total_sales > 5000: Filters out any salesperson whose total sales are $5,000 or less.
This query will return only those salespeople whose aggregated sales_amount (total sales) is above $5,000.
