# SQL (Structured Query Language)

SQL, or Structured Query Language, is the standard language used to interact with relational databases. It allows users to perform a variety of operations, such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting data, often referred to as CRUD operations.

SQL is used to:
- Query databases to retrieve specific data.
- Manage database structures like tables.
- Control access to the data.


SQL is widely used across various database management systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server, making it fundamental for managing and manipulating structured data efficiently.



# SQL Commands Overview

SQL (Structured Query Language) consists of various components to handle different database operations. The major categories are described below.

## DDL (Data Definition Language)

DDL deals with defining and modifying the structure of database objects such as tables, indexes, and schemas.

### Common Commands:
- **CREATE**: Creates new database objects like tables.
- **ALTER**: Modifies existing database objects.
- **DROP**: Deletes database objects.
- **TRUNCATE**: Removes all records from a table without logging individual row deletions.

## DML (Data Manipulation Language)

DML focuses on data manipulation within tables.

### Common Commands:
- **SELECT**: Retrieves data from the database.
- **INSERT**: Adds new records to a table.
- **UPDATE**: Modifies existing records in a table.
- **DELETE**: Removes records from a table.

## DCL (Data Control Language)

DCL manages access and permissions for users in the database.

### Common Commands:
- **GRANT**: Provides specific user privileges.
- **REVOKE**: Removes user privileges.

## TCL (Transaction Control Language)

TCL manages transactions in the database to ensure data integrity.

### Common Commands:
- **COMMIT**: Saves the changes made by a transaction.
- **ROLLBACK**: Undoes the changes made by a transaction.
- **SAVEPOINT**: Sets a save point within a transaction to which you can later roll back.



# Advantages of SQL

SQL offers several key advantages that make it widely used and effective for database management.

## Advantages:

- **SQL has a well-defined standard**: It follows a standardized language that is maintained by organizations like ANSI and ISO, ensuring consistency across different database systems.
  
- **SQL is easy to learn**: The syntax of SQL is straightforward and readable, making it accessible even for beginners.

- **In SQL, we can create multiple views**: SQL allows the creation of multiple views that can simplify complex queries and enhance data security by restricting access to specific data.

- **SQL queries are portable**: SQL code can be run on different database systems with minimal modifications, enhancing portability across platforms.

- **SQL is an interactive language**: SQL allows users to interact with databases dynamically and execute queries in real-time to fetch or manipulate data as needed.

Facts of SQL
1)It was initially called SEQUEL(Structured English Query Language)
2)SQL is powerful language that uses Simple English Sentences
3)SQL is declarative language, which means that it focuses on **what** to do rather than **how** to do it. In declarative languages like SQL, the user specifies **what result** they want from the database, and the database management system decides the best way to execute that request.
