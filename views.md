###
In SQL, a view is a virtual table that is based on the result set of a SELECT query. It doesn't store data itself but provides a way to simplify complex queries by creating a saved query result that can be referenced like a regular table. When you query a view, the database runs the underlying query and returns the result dynamically.

## Key Characteristics of Views
### Virtual Table: A view doesnâ€™t store data physically. Instead, it dynamically pulls data from the tables defined in its query each time it's accessed.

### Read-Only or Updatable: Views can be read-only (most common) or, in certain cases, allow updates that propagate to the underlying tables.

### Simplifies Complex Queries: Views encapsulate complex joins, filters, and aggregations, making it easier to work with frequently used query patterns.

### Provides Security: Views can limit access to specific columns or rows of data, offering a way to control access without exposing the entire underlying table.
