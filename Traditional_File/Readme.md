# Information Storage in Different Computer Files

In traditional file-based systems, information is stored in various files and managed through the file system. However, file-based systems face several limitations, leading to inefficiencies and potential data management issues.

## Problems in File Systems

1. **Limited Data Sharing and Lack of Security**  
   Data stored in files is often difficult to share across different users or applications due to the lack of a standardized format. Additionally, ensuring data security becomes challenging as file systems don't inherently support advanced security measures like user roles or access controls.

2. **Data Redundancy (Multiple Copies of the Same Object)**  
   Since the same data may be stored in different files across multiple locations, duplication and redundancy issues arise. This leads to wasted storage space and potential inconsistencies in data.

3. **Difficulty of Getting Quick Answers**  
   Retrieving specific information from file-based systems can be time-consuming. It often requires manually searching through large sets of files, which is inefficient compared to database systems where data can be queried quickly.

4. **Data Dependency**  
   The structure and format of data in files are often tightly coupled with the application code. This creates strong data dependency, making it difficult to modify the structure of the data without affecting the codebase, leading to inflexibility in the system.
